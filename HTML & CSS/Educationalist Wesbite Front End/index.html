            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The education system in Pakistan[4] is generally divided into six
                levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (grades one through five), middle (grades six
                through eight), high (grades nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC),
                intermediate (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC), and
                university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.[5] The Higher Education Commission
                established in 2002 is responsible for all universities and degree awarding institutes.[6] It was
                established in 2002 with Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS as its Founding Chairman. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The literacy rate ranges from 82% in Islamabad to 23% in the Torghar
                District.[8] Literacy rates vary by gender and region. In tribal areas female literacy is 9.5%,[9] while
                Azad Kashmir has a literacy rate of 74%.[10] Pakistan produces about 445,000 university graduates and
                25,000-30,000 computer science graduates per year.[11] Despite these statistics, Pakistan still has low
                literacy rate.[12] And Pakistan also has the second largest out of school population (22.8 million
                children)[13] after Nigeria. </p>
